# Electric Ising Model

- A simulation of electric polarization in bulk material using a modified 3D Ising model

## Setup

- Electric_Ising.py
- A test is provided for SbTaO4

  - J. Electrochem. Soc, 166 (5) H3195-H3201 (2019); https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.0281905jes

- The 'Main Program' section of the code has been added to a Jupyter Notebook for testing

## Note

- The program is currently incomplete. The mechanics are in place, but the full consideration of contributing factors is not yet flushed out in the code. This is an ongoing task.
