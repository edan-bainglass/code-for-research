# Ising-model based electric polarization simulator

- A simulation of electric polarization in bulk material using a modified 3D Ising model

## Setup

- Electric_Ising.py
- A test is provided for SbTaO4

  - See Journal ofThe Electrochemical Society, 166 (5) H3195-H3201 (2019); https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.0281905jes

- See "Main Program" section of the code for an example run

## Note

- The program is currently incomplete. The mechanics are in place, but the full consideration of contributing factors is not yet flushed out in the code. This is an ongoing task.
